# \*U\* Database Mapping and Research Tool
By the late Larry Hatch.  
I want to thank Adam Kehoe, David Marler, Jérôme Beau, and Richard Geldreich Jr. for their work obtaining, preserving, analyzing, and releasing this program, as well as bringing it to my attention.

## Instructions

`$ unzip u_full_version.zip`  
`$ dosbox`  

Within the DOSBox environment:
```
Z:\> IMGMOUNT.COM C u_full_version.img -size 512,63,255,33
Z:\> C:
C:\> U.EXE
```
You will see a warning about being in the root directory; ignore that and press enter. Wait for the array to load.

## Notes

This repository also contains data files and code for the following blog post, by Adam Kehoe:

[Analyzing The Nearly Lost Hatch Database: 18,123 case 
files](https://web.archive.org/web/20210111082444/https://blog.adamkehoe.com/hatch-udatabase/)

## Fork

Repo initially forked to include the [PDF 
manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20210111232845/https://adamkehoe.com/static/uap/hatch/hatch_manual.pdf).   
Repo now includes a disk image of the full version of the program (not just the demo).
